# Bellabeat - How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?

Performing an exploratory data analysis with either R, SQL or Excel is the final phase of the Google Data Analytics Certificate. 

I decided to go the R route and use the data from [Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit)

## The Data

The available data consists of 18 individual csv files, all focusing on either a specific metric, such as heart rate or sleep, or data collection rate, by the minute, hour or day.

For the analysis, the following three files were used:
* [Daily Activity Merged](https://github.com/zangerls/Bellabeat/blob/main/dailyActivity_merged.csv)
* [Intensity by hour](https://github.com/zangerls/Bellabeat/blob/main/hourlyIntensities_merged.csv)
* [Sleep by day](https://github.com/zangerls/Bellabeat/blob/main/sleepDay_merged.csv)

## The EDA

Before starting the analysis, the data first had to be cleaned, processed and transformed. Afterwards, the datasets were analysed and insights and recommendations were shared.

The [Notebook](https://github.com/zangerls/Bellabeat/blob/main/bellabeat.ipynb) is carefully detailed and documented.

## The PowerPoint

To effectively and concisely share the insights and recommendations from the analysis, I decided to also create a PowerPoint highlighting the key points from the notebook.
