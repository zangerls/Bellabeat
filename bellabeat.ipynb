That includes identifying when and how participants used their fitness tracker, as well as how different groups of users differ in bevaviour from one another. \n\nApart from supporting the upcoming marketing campaign, other goals of this analysis are customer segmentation of fitness tracker users and optimizing features of Bellabeats smart-devices.\n\n#### Stakeholders\nThe stakeholders during this analysis are Urška Sršen and Sando Mur, cofounders and executives of Bellabeat. Additionally, the marketing team behind Bellabeat are also key-stakeholders, as this report aims to directly influence their upcoming campaigns.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Phase 2: Prepare\n#### Integrity\nThe data for this process comes from a public dataset from Kaggle.

This might be one of the reasons for their shorter distance travelled and less activity done on that day as seen in the plots above. They sleep about half an hour longer than the mean on Sunday. However, sleeping longer doesn't necessarily cause the drop in activity, as participants also sleep longer on Saturday than during the week, where they exercise the most.\n\n#### Conclusions:\n* Participants sleep the longest on Sunday.\n\n#### Recommendations:\n* Send customers helpful information on healthy sleeping habits and patterns to not oversleep.\n* Recommend users when to set their alarm based on the time they go to bed. E.g. when going to bed at 10, set alarm earlier than when going to bed at 11 (on weekend).\n* Offer customers easy access to their sleeping data for them to analyze their sleeping habits themselves.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_intensity$ActivityHour = as.POSIXct(df_intensity$ActivityHour, format=\"%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p\")\ndf_intensity$Time <- format(df_intensity$ActivityHour, format = \"%H:%M:%S\")\ndf_intensity$Date <- as.Date(df_intensity$ActivityHour, format = \"%m/%d/%y\")\ndf_intensity$WeekDay <- weekdays(df_intensity$Date)\nglimpse(df_intensity)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-25T06:13:58.405961Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-25T06:13:58.407598Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-25T06:13:58.479641Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Looking at intensity by time of day\n\nIn the last step of this analysis, we dive even deeper into the habits of our participants, looking at it on an hourly basis.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"combine_by_hour <- df_intensity %>%\n  group_by(Time) %>%\n  summarise(MeanIntensity = mean(TotalIntensity))\n\ncombine_by_hour","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-25T06:13:58.482866Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-25T06:13:58.484538Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-25T06:13:58.523362Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ggplot(data=combine_by_hour) +\n    geom_bar(mapping=aes(x=Time,y=MeanIntensity),stat=\"identity\") +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-25T06:13:58.526985Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-25T06:13:58.528613Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-25T06:13:58.739578Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Plotting the average intensity by our participants for every hour of the day, we can see the biggest spike of intense activity between 5 and 7 p.m. After that we see a steep decline until early in the morning again.

However, with this data of another fitness tracker, we can tell that most of the customers work roughly a 9-5 schedule, looking at when they decide to work out. Furthermore, many of the participants spend a significant time sat down, prompting us to believe these people might work regular desk jobs.\n\n**Important insight:**\nFitness tracker users aren't necessarily avid athletes. Bellabeat's target audience contains everyone in the process of or thinking about adapting to a healthier lifestyle. This directly affects the upcoming marketing campaign, as the actors in it, if any are planned, should cover various body types and lifestyle situations of women. Not just athletes.\n\n#### Problems customers can solve\nThanks to our analysis we could identify many slight health risks and trends that, without a fitness tracker, would go by unnoticed. These include total steps in a day, time slept, workout intensity by day and even hour, heartrate, and many more.\n\nAll of these features are important selling points for all the smart products of Bellabeat and should be advertised in the campaign.\n\n#### App/Tracker Features\nMany of the recommended features for the smart devices by Bellabeat have already been named and explained in the analysis. Here are the most significant ones.\n* Dashboard for users to recap on activity, steps, sleep, etc.\n* Notifications for unhealthy behaviour such as long sedentary time and over sleeping.\n* Reminders to stand up after sitting for an extended period of time, to go to bed soon or not to forget to eat or workout.\n\n# **Thank you**\nfor taking interest in this case study.\n-SZ","metadata":{}}]}
